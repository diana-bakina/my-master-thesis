# Inner vs. External Speech: Corpus-Based Linguistic Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts and annotated data used in my MA thesis on the linguistic features of spontaneous inner speech compared to external conversational speech. The study applies corpus-linguistic methods to identify structural and functional differences between the two speech types.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Input data tables for inner (IE) and external (AS) speech units
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing, analysis, and visualization
- `figures/`: Output plots and charts (if available)
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies

## Project Summary

The thesis explores how spontaneous inner speech (collected via Descriptive Experience Sampling) differs from external conversational speech in:
- syntactic complexity
- linguistic economy
- presence of disfluencies and laughter
- structural unit types (e.g. full sentences vs. fragments)

The analysis uses annotated corpora and computes metrics such as:
- Words per clause (W/C)
- Words per unit (W/IE, W/AS)
- Clauses per unit (C/IE, C/AS)
- Coordinated clauses per unit (Coord/IE, Coord/AS)
- Dependent clauses per clause (DC/C)
